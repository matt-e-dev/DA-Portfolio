        <p class="container-text">
          After completing my Umschulung in E-Commerce Management, 
          including my IHK exam, I decided to expand my expertise and immerse myself in the world of coding. <br> <br>
          During my college time, I regularly joined the programmers’ group in the afternoons to learn and practice coding, 
          which further fueled my motivation to pursue web development more seriously. To build on this foundation,
           I joined Developer Akademie, where I recently completed a comprehensive frontend development training program.

              >During the intense frontend development program, I quickly realized that to push beyond my limitations, I needed a structured way to absorb and retain new knowledge. That’s why I developed a personal note-taking system, helping me organize concepts, track solutions, and reflect on what I’ve learned. 
              This method not only strengthened my understanding but also made me more efficient in tackling complex problems. <br><br>
